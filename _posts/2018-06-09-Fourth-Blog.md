  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying multiple different techniques whenever I got a certain part of the course wrong. Some of them included just reading back through what I'd done and checking that everything that is coded actually made sense and as in the right order. Step two was to check for any small details that I may have either missed out or misplaced in the lines of code. Step three was correct these mistakes or ( if there were none) read through the instructions on the left again and see if I had followed them correctly. If that still failed, then (and only then) would I look at the solution. Luckily I do not have to do this very often. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was all the tiny errors that I made, eg: not putting speech marks around strings and other stuff like that. It limited the amount of work I was able to do because I had to keep going back to correct these tiny mistakes. I need to work on (still) making sure that I have done a respectable amount of work in the lesson myself before even thinking about helping other people. Other things that limited my learning was sometimes the fact that the instructions were extremely long-winded. This confused me slightly, so I had to spend more time reading the instructions before moving on to the activity itself.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is that I will go slightly slower through the activities and make sure that I get the solutions right. I believe that this will improve my learning as I will be able to go on to harder and more advanced things quicker than before. </td>
