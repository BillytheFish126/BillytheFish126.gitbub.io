    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by just going through the code in a very sensible order. Using this technique, I was able to complete seven sections of code, also seven badges (one of these I was very close to finishing last lesson). I am extremely pleased with the progress made. I have also just started the, "battleship!" section and look forward to continuing that in the next lesson. The strategy that I found effective was just ploughing through the work, not as fast as possible, but obviously I did work fast, but by just not making many errors, and the few errors that I did make were small and did not greatly hinder me. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was (again) all the tiny errors that I made, eg: not putting speech marks around strings and other stuff like that. This is the thing that I do really need to work on and get sorted. Apart from that, there wasn't really anything that I could have done in the lesson to speed up my working process. The habit that I need to work on is not going over to other people and getting distracted from my own work. This is extremely important, as being able to work for long periods of time is very useful and will allow me to proceed quicker. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is the amount of time that I spend up and helping others around me. I will also finally abolish my habits of not putting the small things into my work, eg: the speech marks around a string. This will, in turn, improve my learning. </td>
