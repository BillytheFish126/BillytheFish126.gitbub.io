    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by (again) trying different techniques for different parts of the tutorials. I managed to obtain two badges this lesson. The strategies that I used for different parts obviously varied from one another.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was my inability to stop helping other people before myself. I need to work on just putting my head down and working. This should (in theory) allow me get on with more work. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is how much I help other people. I think that this will, ultimately, improve my learning.  The other thing that I will do to improve my learning is that I will just immediately start my work, rather than waiting a couple of minutes to start. </td>
