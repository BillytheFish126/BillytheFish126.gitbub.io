    <td>In today's lesson I was able to finally complete the python course. I am extremely pleased with the amount of progress that I made in this lesson, and I think that it is good that I was able to fully complete the whole course in the space of 8 weeks. I am extremely happy about me not having to do much work at home to catch up, as some people have had to do that if they have been working too slowly. I learnt by (as always) just keeping going with the work at hand, and it would appear that it has paid off. This has been a very effective strategy throughout the whole course, and maybe I will find a new work ethic when I move on.</td>

    <td>There wasn’t really anything that limited my learning that was new, however, my old habits of forgetting to put speech marks around strings and other things like that did come back to me this lesson, along with the lines. These are still haunting me, and I hope to start a new life without these unnecessary lines in my new course. These are the only real habits that I need to work on. I suppose that I could be a little bit quieter in lessons as at the moment I whisper to my neighbor about the work a bit, so I could stop that to improve my learning. </td>

    <td>These are very easy questions to answer:
Obviously the thing that I will change for next time is the actual course that I work on. What said course will be, I do not yet know. I will improve my learning by moving onto a different course, therefore I shall expand my learning of this subject (IT). </td>
