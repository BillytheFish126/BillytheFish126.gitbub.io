    <td>Today was rather different to the other days because we were allowed to just touch up on the different aspects that we had not finished on our code. So, in a way, today was a day to finish it all off. I learnt by getting help from friends who had finished and sometimes helping other people in parts they found hard. This was an effective strategy. </td>
