    <td>In this lesson I was able to go through tons of code, I have gone through about 20% more of the course in this lesson. I am extremely pleased with the amount of work I have done, as I think that it shows the amount of effort that I have put in. I am now 55% through the course and have acquired 13 badges in the process. I am currently working on the "battleship" piece. The strategy that I found effective was (again) just going through the work at a steady pace, and making sure that I read the instructions on the left correctly for the first time so that I didn't have to keep re-reading. This was particularly important, as it allowed me to go through the work much faster, and I think that is reflected in the amount of work I was able to complete in the lesson. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was (again) the small things, eg: not putting the speech marks around strings. However, this did happen a lot less this lesson, so I have definitely taken my own advice form the last blog, but I do need to still take heed. This is pretty much the only habit that I need to work on, but if I had to name one other thing, I suppose it would be that I still go and help other people before completing a good amount of work in the lesson. This also isn’t happening as much any more, but I’m sure it will stop very soon, as it has been going down in the last few lessons.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is that I will make sure that what I code is correct the first time that I type it, I will also make sure that I have completed an adequate amount of work before I go on and help others (if they need it). This will make me more fast and efficient in the lesson. I will improve my learning by really absorbing all the code that I do in the lesson. I am looking forward to continuing coding my battleship game next lesson!</td>
