    <td>I learnt by making sure that the code that I put in was in line with the instructions on the left. This was a very effective strategy, as it meant that I only had to put in my code once, because I was looking at the example and how I was supposed to do it. In this lesson, I was able to complete the courses Battleship!, Loops, and Practise makes Perfect. I found practise makes perfect very useful, as it made me go over some of the stuff that I'd done in previous courses and previous lessons. This allowed me to refresh my memory on how to do some of the programs. This was very effective.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited my learning this lesson, but if I had to say one thing I suppose it would be that I could work a little bit faster. This would help me finish the course sooner and then I would be able to move onto html faster. The habit that I need to work on is as soon as I get into the classroom, I just need to sign in, open up this blog and then just open up codecademy and get straight into it so that I can get the maximum amount of work done in the lesson as possible. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is that I will settle down right at the beginning and then get the maximum amount of work done as possible in the hour that we have. To improve my learning, I will just work faster. This will allow me to reach new "levels" in the python coursework, so I will learn more. </td>
