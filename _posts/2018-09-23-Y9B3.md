    <td> I learnt by (again) just listening to the teacher and placing the code when and where I was supposed to. This was a very good strategy, as the teacher showed us even more of the code than last time. I realised there was more to my Caesar Code today, and I should have it working by next week. </td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning today was people signing me out of my computer, so I had to keep signing in again, and this slowed me down greatly. Hopefully this won't happen next time, so it shouldnâ€™t be a problem. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is that I will work faster in order to complete as much of the work as possible. This will improve my learning, as it means we can move onto other, harder things more quickly.</td>
