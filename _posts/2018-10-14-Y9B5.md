    <td> Yet again, I purely listened to the teacher and put in the correct code in the correct places. This was a rather effective strategy as it allowed me to finish all the work with some time to spare. This spare time allowed me to colour it in and make it look nicer. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that limited my learning was other people signing me out of my computer while the teacher talked to us and while we discussed possible solutions to the problems. I don't think that there are any habits that I need to work on right now.</td>

    <td>The thing that I will change for next time will be that obviously I will change the code on my sheet and this should (in turn) progress my learning. </td>
