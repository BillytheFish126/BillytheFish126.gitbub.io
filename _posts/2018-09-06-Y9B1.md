    <td>I learnt by listening to the teacher extremely closely and following his instructions. Though, there were not many instructions to follow, as we spent pretty much all of our lesson time discussing what we do in year 9 IT and what Google Spreadsheets are and how powerful they are. We were asked to break a code and by the the end of the lesson we had broke it, however, when we were asked to encode it on Spreadsheets the bell went, which inhibited the amount of time in which we could do this.  </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited my learning, as we were just being talked to and suggesting ideas. So in that sense, nothing inhibited my learning. I don't have a habit to work on, because (again) we were just being talked to and suggesting ideas. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I donâ€™t think I will change for next time, as the lesson passed perfectly smoothly and without major interruption. I think that my learning will improve next lesson when we start our own spreadsheet. </td>
