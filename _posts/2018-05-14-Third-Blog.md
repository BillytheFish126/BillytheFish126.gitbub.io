  <tr>
    <td>I learned by just keeping going with the code, even if it didn't work at the start, I kept going with the code to try and complete it. In the lesson, I managed to complete the sections Strong and Console output and Date and Time. Out of lesson time, I have decided to do it as an occasional extracurricular activity, and have (so far) achieved two more badges. The strategies that worked for me included trying out tiny variations of the code that I had put in, as most of the mistakes that I had made were little errors that could easily have been corrected if I had looked close enough. Obviously, all these mistakes I made (and corrected) are now in my head so I know how not to make the same mistakes next time. With Strings, I kept on forgetting to put speech marks around the phrase/s that I needed to use for the code.

  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning we're the tiny little errors that I made which (afterwards) made a really quite substantial impact. I need to work on memorising these mistakes and making sure that they do not keep on popping up suddenly. This will allow me to advance through my work much faster than before, as I will not need to go back and correct errors that I have made. This is what limited my learning and I will work on this. Another habit that I still need to work on is not helping others before myself. Of course, this is something that is very noble in life, however in IT lessons, it is vital that I settle and focus faster. This is something that I need to work on to improve for next time. Which leads us nicely into the next section...</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I will change for next time are (again) the small errors that I make, eg not putting the speech marks on strings. This will, in turn, improve my learning because I wonâ€™t have to keep on going back and correcting my mistakes and errors which means that I can spend more time moving on the the more advanced sides of python. This will allow me to advance much quicker and, in turn, get much more done this term whilst we are doing python before we move into year 9. I will also improve my learning by not helping others before myself, as this is still something that I do. For some reason, it is a habit that I cannot curb, it is rather annoying. I need to settle down and focus on my own work and this will also let me get more work done. </td>
