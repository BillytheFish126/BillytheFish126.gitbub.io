    <td>In the lesson today I was able to complete three sections and I am now 85% through the course. This lesson, I was able to complete the courses Exam Statistics, Advanced Topics in Python and an Introduction to Bitwise Operators. I learnt in the Advanced Topics in Python section by thinking back to my previous work and just inputting that into the advanced work with the added material that was required for the certain question at hand. This was an extremely effective strategy for the advanced section. For the others, I just worked strategically and I think it paid off.

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the fact that sometimes I either forget or don't know to add a line before starting my own code if there is already code ready there for me above it. This does pose a problem, as I cannot continue without putting the line in so it means I am stuck for a length of time. Sometimes, I alter the code because I can’t continue so I start to doubt myself and the code that I’ve put in, and then that is actually wrong. So this is a habit that I need to work on, putting a line in or not putting a line in. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is the consistency that I put the lines into my work. I will read the instructions much more carefully to see if it specifies whether I should put them in or not. I believe that this will in turn improve my learning experience in the IT lessons. It will also allow me to go through work much faster so that (in turn) I can get a better learning experience. </td>
